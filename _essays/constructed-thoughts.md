Thinking itself, fundamentally, interests humans. We created languages, and constructed philosophies for thoughts, and we found them interesting. **The Constructed Thoughts** project aims to create a thinking system that will not only work for humans, but also machines.

### The Differences Between Thoughts and Science

This project is more like a philosophical attempt, rather than a formal science. The purpose of science is to solve problems for present, and to predict things in the future. However, a philosophical thinking system would aim more at creating things.

### Examinable

However, instead of being a way to explain the surrounding world, The Constructed Thoughts project aims to create rules and principles, and therefore be examinable.

Thinking is a complicated process, but here it will be simple. This project aims to be able to be used by a computer, and theories such as probabilistic programming may be involved.
