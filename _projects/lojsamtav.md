lojsamtav is an attempt to use Lojban as a
programming language.

Proposal
--------

A new language design can be found at [Lojysamtav: A Proposal](/essays/lojsamtav-a-proposal.html).

Insipration
-----------

lojysamtav is inspired by [lojysamban][] by .iocikun.juj. The basic idea
is to make a Prolog-like programming language using a subset of Lojban
so that human beings can directly talk to computers. It is also inspired
by [a talk][] by Tavis Rudd.

Prototype
---------

A working prototype can be found at [here](https://lojysamtav.ns.mg).
